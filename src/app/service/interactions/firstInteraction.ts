Through the MetaCartel network, we assembled a fellowship of the best builders, designers and hustlers in the space in order to make this future a reality. By sharing resources, branding and collaboration tools, we can create positive-sum value for the Ethereum ecosystem in a way that has never been possible before the advent of DAOs. \n\nWe believe in Web3 and are here to build it, use it, and propagate it. The profits from our work will be used to fund development of open source tooling and public goods. We will share the learnings from our experiments and open source our processes for the community to learn and build from. \n\n*If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.* \n\n------------------------------------------------ \n\nThe tavern keeper offers you a drink. Press :beer: to accept it.',
